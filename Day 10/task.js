Explanation:
The code sets the variable num to 1, and then enters a while loop. The while loop continues as long as num is less than or equal to 10.

In each iteration of the loop, the current value of num is logged to the console using console.log(num), and then num is incremented by 2 using num += 2.

The loop continues until num is greater than 10, at which point the loop stops and the code execution is complete.

The output of the code will be:(4,8,12,16,20)

Explanation:
The code sets the variable num to 1, and then enters a while loop. The while loop continues as long as num is less than or equal to 20.

In each iteration of the loop, a check is made to see if the current value of num is divisible by 4 using num % 4 === 0. If num is divisible by 4, the current value of num is logged to the console using console.log(num).

Regardless of whether num is divisible by 4 or not, num is incremented by 1 using num++.

The loop continues until num is greater than 20, at which point the loop stops and the code execution is complete.
