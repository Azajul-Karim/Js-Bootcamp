What is JavaScript?

- JS is the most popular scripting languange in the world.

- JS official name is ECMAScript.

- JS is used primarilly to add interactivity to the web page.
  EXample: Dropdown, slider, animation, event etc.
  Interactivity:

- Add new HTML to the page, change the existing content and modify style.

- React to user actions, run on mouse clicks, pointer movement etc.

- Send request over the network to remote servers, download and upload file (called AJAX).

- Get and set cookies, ask question to the visitor, show message.

- Remember the data on the client-side ("local storage")
  Scope of JavaScript:

- Inside the Browser (Client side JavaScript).

- Outside of the Browser (Server side JavaScript-Node js).
  Scripting languages Vs Programming language:

- Scripting language are interpreted.

- Interpreter read line by line code and run and optimized slow. But development of just-in-time compilation this gap is shrinking.

- Programming language are compiled.

- compiler translate the whole code at a time and then run and optimized fast.

- compiled ad interpreted take human-readable code ane convert it to computer-readable machine code.
- Human Readable code (Ex-JS, Python etc) -> interpreted/compiled -> Machine Code.

- The JS use several engine for interpreted. Example- V8, Spider Monkey, chakra.

- V-8 Engine is most popular. Its use by default Chrome Browser.

- Node js work by V-8 Engine.
  ECMAScript Specification:

- Define the standard (Rule) for the implementation of JS in different Browser.

  History of JS:
  JavaScript is a high-level, object-oriented, dynamic programming language that was first introduced in 1995. The language was developed by Brendan Eich, a software engineer at Netscape Communications Corporation. It was originally created as a scripting language for web browsers to make web pages dynamic and interactive.
  In 1996, JavaScript became an official specification of the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA). This marked the beginning of the standardization of the language and opened up the opportunity for developers to create cross-platform applications.
  In the early 2000s, JavaScript became popular for creating interactive web applications, especially with the rise of Ajax technology, which allowed for dynamic and asynchronous data exchange between the browser and the server.
  In recent years, JavaScript has evolved into a full-fledged programming language that can be used for a variety of purposes beyond web development, including server-side programming, desktop applications, and mobile development. It has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world, and its popularity continues to grow.
  Overall, JavaScript has come a long way since its inception in 1995 and has proven to be a versatile and powerful tool for developers across the world.
